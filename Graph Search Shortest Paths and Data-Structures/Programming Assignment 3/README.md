# Goal
Implement Heap application: Median Maintenence
# File Description
- `.txt` files is data file.
  - `Median.txt`: undirected weighted graph with 10,000 integers with unsorted order
- `.py` file is the solution of Week 2 program assignment
  - `Median.py`
  
# Algorithm
- Median Maintenence Algorithm [Reference](https://github.com/SSQ/Coursera-Stanford-Graph-Search-Shortest-Paths-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/Lecture%20Slides/12.2-slides_algo-ds-heaps-basics_typed.pdf)
