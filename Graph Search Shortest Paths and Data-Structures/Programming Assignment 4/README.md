# Goal
Implement 2-sum algorithm
# File Description
- `.txt` files is data file.
  - `2sum.txt`: undirected weighted graph with 1 million integers
- `.py` file is the solution of Week 2 program assignment
  - `2sum.py`
  
# Algorithm
- [2-sum](https://github.com/SSQ/Coursera-Stanford-Graph-Search-Shortest-Paths-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/Lecture%20Slides/14.1-slides_algo-ds-hash-basics_typed.pdf)
